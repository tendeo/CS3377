# NutriGuide — Login Screen Demo

This repository is a minimal Vite + React skeleton that implements the Figma-provided Login screen for the NutriGuide app.

Quick start (macOS, zsh):

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open the shown local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- This is a UI-only demo. No auth backend is wired.
- Tailwind is used for styling; the provided CSS variables from the Figma starter are included in `src/styles.css`.
